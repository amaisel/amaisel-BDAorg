    "> *How many possible binary logical operations are there?*  Don't just report a number; briefly explain your reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are $2^{2^n}$ possible binary logical operations, where n is the number of variables being introduced. This is intuitive, since any single vairable (i.e. A) can take on one of two values, $A$ and $\\overline A$, and a variable B also has these two states, B and $\\overline B$. When we combine these, we have $2^{4} = 16$ possible situations, (i.e. $A$, $A \\land B$, $A \\land \\overline B$, etc.) If a third variable C were introduced, we would have $2^8 =256$ options, and so on. Thus, we have $2^{2^n}$ combinations for a given number of variables to be evaluated.\n"

A key component of a CPU chip in a computer is an *arithmetic logic unit* (ALU) that performs arithmetic and bitwise logic operations on bits and larger groups of binary digits (*nibbles* comprised of 4 bits, *bytes* comprised of 8 bits, and *words* comprised of multiple bytes).

However, this probability, the likelihood $P(bi|B)$ in this case, does not take into account the fact that only 15% of cabs are actually Blue. Thus, using only the likelihood, rather than the Prior x Likelihood. Since the prior is small in this case, there is a significant difference between the 80% heuristic and the actual result of ~41%. \n",
